    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const newArray = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // console.log(players);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    // const oneWay = new Array(...players);
    const anotherWay = Array.from(players);
    const slice = players.slice();
    players[0] = 'Nico';

    // console.log(oneWay, anotherWay, slice);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const thirdWay = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const es6Way = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Someone',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 20, number: 1111})
    // console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap3 = {...person}
    // console.log(cap3)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const nico = {
      name: "Nico",
      age: 31,
      social: {
        twitter: '@nico',
        facebook: 'nico.martinez'
      }
    };

    const shallow = Object.assign({}, nico);

    const deep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(nico));
